# DBpedia Lookup

DBpedia Lookup is a web service that can be used to look up DBpedia URIs by related keywords. Related means that either the label of a resource matches, or an anchor text that was frequently used in Wikipedia to refer to a specific resource matches (for example the resource http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States can be looked up by the string "USA"). The results are ranked by the number of inlinks pointing from other Wikipedia pages at a result page.

## Web APIs

Two APIs are offered: Keyword Search and Prefix Search. A hosted version of the Lookup service is available on the DBpedia server infrastructure.

### Keyword Search

The Keyword Search API can be used to find related DBpedia resources for a given string. The string may consist of a single or multiple words.

Example: Places that have the related keyword "berlin"

http://lookup.dbpedia.org/api/search/KeywordSearch?QueryClass=place&QueryString=berlin

### Prefix Search (i.e. Autocomplete)

The Prefix Search API can be used to implement autocomplete input boxes. For a given partial keyword like *berl* the API returns URIs of related DBpedia resources like http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin.

Example: Top five resources for which a keyword starts with "berl"

http://lookup.dbpedia.org/api/search/PrefixSearch?QueryClass=&MaxHits=5&QueryString=berl

### Parameters

The query parameters accepted by the endpoints are

* `QueryString`: a string for which a DBpedia URI should be found.
* `QueryClass`: a DBpedia class from the Ontology that the results should have (for owl#Thing and untyped resource, leave this parameter empty).
* `MaxHits`: the maximum number of returned results (default: 5)

### JSON support

By default all data is returned as XML, the service also retuns JSON to any request including the `Accept: application/json` header.

## Running a local mirror of the webservice

### Clone and build the project

    git clone git://github.com/dbpedia/lookup.git
    cd lookup
    mvn clean install

### Download and configure the index

    wget http://spotlight.dbpedia.org/download/dbpedia-lookup-index-3.8.tgz
    tar zxvf dbpedia-lookup-index-3.8.tgz

### Run the server

    ./run Server dbpedia-lookup-index-3.8

The server should now be running at http://localhost:1111

## Rebuilding the index

Rebuilding an index is usually not required, if you only intend on running a local mirror of the service you can donwload a prebuilt index as outlined above.

To re-build the index you will require

* DBpedia datasets
* pignlproc output from [nerd-stats.pig](https://github.com/dbpedia-spotlight/pignlproc/blob/master/examples/nerd-stats/nerd-stats.pig)
* Unix


### Get the following DBpedia datasets
from http://downloads.dbpedia.org/current/en/

* redirects\_en.nt
* short\_abstracts\_en.nt
* instance\_types\_en.nt
* article\_categories\_en.nt

### Concatenate all data and sort by URI

This is necessary because indexing in sorted order is significantly faster.

      cat instance_types_en.nt  \
          short_abstracts_en.nt \
          article_categories_en.nt | sort >all_dbpedia_data.nt

### Get the dataset redirects\_en.nt

Redirects are not indexed, but they are excluded as targets of lookup.

### Run Indexer

The indexer has to be run twice:

1. with the DBpedia data 

        ./run Indexer lookup_index_dir redirects_en.nt all_dbpedia_data.nt

2. with the pignlproc data

        ./run Indexer lookup_index_dir redirects_en.nt nerd_stats_output.tsv

## Support and feedback

The best way to get support or give feedback on the Lookup project is via the [DBpedia discussion mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dbpedia-discussion). More technical queries about the code base should be directed to the [DBpedia developers mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dbpedia-developers).

The [DBpedia wiki](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/lookup/) also has useful information on the project.
